# Hands-on Jenkins-06 : Agent Node Configuration and DSL Job

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to learn how to configure an agent node to Jenkins Server. 

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- configure a agent node

- run jobs on agent node.

- create job DSL

## Outline

- Part 1 - Agent Node Configuration

- Part 2 - Free Style Project on Agent Node

- Part 3 - Pipeline Project on Agent Node

- Part 4 - Jenkins Job DSL

## Part 1 - Agent Node Configuration

- Launch an instance on Amazon Linux 2023 AMI with security group allowing SSH (port 22) as agent node.

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

- Install Java
  
```bash
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install java-11-amazon-corretto -y
```

- Install Git
  
```bash
sudo dnf install git -y
```

- Instal  `Command Agent Launcher Plugin` on Jenkins controller.

- Follow `Manage Jenkins` -> `Manage Plugins` path and install the plugins (install without restart):

  -  `Command Agent Launcher Plugin`

- **Configure ssh connection between controller and agent nodes.**

- Go to the Jenkins Controller server: 
  - Switch to "jenkins" user.

```bash
sudo su - jenkins -s /bin/bash
```

  - Generate a public and private key with keygen.

```bash
ssh-keygen
```
  - Press enter for every question to continue with default options. 

  - Check ".ssh" folder and see public(id_rsa.pub) and private keys(id_rsa). 

```bash
cd .ssh
ls
```
  - We need to copy public key to agent node.

```bash
cat id_rsa.pub
```
  - Select and copy all the codes in id_rsa.pub.

- Go to the /root/.ssh folder on the agent node instance.

```bash
sudo su
cd /root/.ssh
```

- Open the "authorized_keys" file with an editor and paste the code that you copied from public key(id_rsa.pub). Save "authorized_keys" file.

- Get the agent node ip:

```bash
ifconfig
```
- Copy ip number.

- Go to the Jenkins Controller server and test ssh connection.

```bash
ssh root@<agent-node-ip-number>
exit
```

- **The second one is to copy agent file from Jenkins server to agent node.**

- Go to the "/root" folder on the agent node instance. Create a folder under "/root" and name it as "bin". Get agent file from Jenkins Controller server.

```bash
mkdir bin
cd bin
wget http://<jenkins_controller_ip>:8080/jnlpJars/agent.jar
```

Command Agent Launcher

- Go to Jenkins dashboard, click on ``Manage Jenkins`` from left hand menu.

- Select ``Manage Nodes and Clouds``

- Click on ``New Node`` from left hand menu.

- Enter `AgentNode-1` in ``Node name`` field and select `Permanent Agent`.

- Click `ok` button.

- Enter `This is a linux agent node for jenkins` in the description field.

- ``Number of executors`` is the maximum number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on this node. Enter `2` in this field.

- An agent needs to have a directory dedicated to Jenkins. Specify the path to this directory on the agent. Enter `/usr/jenkins` in the ``Remote root directory`` field.

- Enter `Linux` in the ``Labels`` field.

- Select `Launch agent via execution of command on the controller` from dropdown menu in the ``Launch method`` field.

- Enter `ssh -i /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/<the_key_file> root@<agent_ip> java -jar -Djava.io.tmpdir=/mnt /root/bin/agent.jar` in the ``Launch command`` field.

- Select `Keep this agent online as much as possible` from dropdown menu in the ``Availability`` field.

- Click `Save`.

- Check the console logs in case of failure to launch agent node. If there is a approvement issue go to `Manage Jenkins`,  select the `In-process Script Approval`, `approve` the script.

- Go to Jenkins dashboard. Check controller and agent nodes on the left hand menu. 

## Part 2 - Free Style Project on Agent Node

- Open your Jenkins dashboard and click on `New Item` to create a new job item.

- Enter `agent-job` then select `free style project` and click `OK`.

  - Enter `My first simple free style job on agent node` in the description field.

  - Find the `General` section, click "Restrict where this project can be run" and enter `Linux` for ``Label Expression``

  - Go to `Build` section and choose ``Execute Shell Command`` step from `Add build step` dropdown menu.

  - Write down just ``echo "Hello World, This is a job for agent node"` to execute shell command, in text area shown.

  - Click `apply` and `save`  buttons.

- Go to `agent job`.

- Select `Build Now` on the left hand menu

- Check "Build Queue" section to see build process running on agent node on the left hand menu. 

## Part 3 - Pipeline Project on Agent Node

- Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on `New Item` to create a pipeline.

- Enter `simple-pipeline-on-agent-node` then select `Pipeline` and click `OK`.

- Enter `My first simple pipeline on agent node` in the description field.

- Go to the `Pipeline` section, enter following script, then click `apply` and `save`.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent { label 'Linux' }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                echo "Clarusway_Way to Reinvent Yourself"
                sh 'echo second step'
                sh 'echo another step'
                sh 'sleep 30'
                sh '''
                echo 'working on'
                echo 'agent node'
                '''
          
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Go to the project page and click `Build Now`.

- Explain the built results.

- Explain the pipeline script.


## Part 4 - Jenkins Job DSL

- Install `Job DSL` plugin

- Go to the dashboard and create a `Seed Job` in form of `Free Style Project`. To do so;

- Click on `New Item`

  - Enter name as `Maven-Seed-Job`

  - Select `Freestyle project`

  - Click `OK`

- Inside `Source Code Management` tab

  - Select `Git`
  
  - Select the path to download the DSL file, so for `Repository URL`, enter `https://github.com/clarusway-aws-devops/jenkins-project-settings.git`

- Inside `Build Options` tab

  - From `Add build step`, select the `Process Job DSLs`.

  - for `Look on Filesystem` `DSL Scripts`, enter `MavenProjectDSL.groovy`
  
- Now click the  `Build Now` option, it will fail. Check the console log for the fail reason.

- Go to `Manage Jenkins` ,  select the `In-process Script Approval`, `approve` the script.
  
- Go to the job and click the  `Build Now` again.

- Observe that DSL Job created.

- Go to the `First-Maven-Project-Via-DSL` job.

- Select `Configure`, at `Build` section set `Maven Version` to a defined/valid one.

- `Save` and click the `Build Now` option.

- Check the console log

- Note: git configuration needs to be set for Jenkins user
    
    - Switch to "jenkins" user and configure git.

```bash
sudo su - jenkins
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

- Back to the job tab and show the `Last Successful Artifacts : webapp-runner.jar`

## Optional - Using Docker with Pipeline

- The devops engineers have been writing Jenkins pipelines for awhile, but they’ve been constrained by the tooling that’s available on jenkins agent and had to be constrained by specific versions of specific tools on specific agents. You can use a container as your build agent. As a pipeline author, it gives you the ability to define the tools and the specific versions of those tools that you want to use in your pipeline so that those items are not being mandated or managed by others.

- Install  `docker pipeline` on Jenkins controller.

- Follow `Manage Jenkins` -> `Manage Plugins` path and install the plugins (install without restart):

  -  `docker pipeline`
  
- Connect to Jenkins server with SSH.

- Install and configure docker.
  
```bash
# install docker
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins
# configure docker as cloud agent for jenkins
sudo cp /lib/systemd/system/docker.service /lib/systemd/system/docker.service.bak
sudo sed -i 's/^ExecStart=.*/ExecStart=\/usr\/bin\/dockerd -H tcp:\/\/127.0.0.1:2376 -H unix:\/\/\/var\/run\/docker.sock/g' /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```
  
- Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on `New Item` to create a pipeline.

```yml
- new item:
- pipeline: docker-agent-pipeline


- General:
- Description : This pipeline builds on docker agent.

- Pipeline:
    Definition:
        Pipeline script from SCM:
            Git:
                Repository URL:
                    - https://github.com/clarusway-aws-devops/java-tomcat-sample-main.git
                
                Branches to build: It must be same branch name with your `jenkins-first-webhook-project` Github repository. If your repository's default branch name is "main", then change "master" to "main".
				
	script path: Jenkinsfile3
```

- `Apply` and `Save` the pipeline configuration.

- Go to the Jenkins project page and click `Build Now`.

- Observe about `Jenkinsfile3` and console output.
